# Crammer
A web typeface for the internet animation-based company, ATC, and currently under beta. 
Other variations have not been created but are planned: Narrow, Text, Wide, and Monospace (little test for coding.)

Why Crammer? 
Because the Lexend-edited (hence its OFL-free use) font wasn't good over time for the brand, a original font with improved x-height has to be created. It has improved x-height, and some alternates (you have to find them in the vfc file, I hadn't figured a way to implement it in other use like Character Map or Inkscape yet.

The font is used for suitable sizes, but is temporarily in use for Title. Test drives are appreciated.

Whereas Narrow, serves as a secondary title effect. 
Text is the main version, and good for lyric/captions. 
Wide is for super eye-catching display wording. 
Monospace version is for - as said before, coding. And probably some other use as well. 
(they will be produced after writing this.)

This font project had been created September 20, 2024, and mostly handled by me.

# Changelog
